# Chaos-Driven-Optimization-for-N-Queens-CDONQ
## Abstract

CDO-NQ is a novel optimization algorithm inspired by chaos theory and genetic algorithms. Specifically designed for solving the N-Queens problem, CDO-NQ introduces controlled chaos to efficiently explore the solution space. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's principles, components, and usage.

## Introduction

The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without any two queens threatening each other. CDO-NQ leverages chaos theory to introduce perturbation and genetic algorithm operators for evolving solutions. The algorithm aims to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to the N-Queens problem efficiently.

## Algorithm Overview

CDO-NQ operates in a generational manner, iteratively perturbing the population using chaos-driven mechanisms and applying genetic algorithm operators to evolve solutions. The main components include initialization, chaos-driven perturbation, genetic algorithm operators (crossover and mutation), fitness evaluation, and reproduction.
