# Chaos-Driven-Optimization-for-N-Queens-CDONQ
## Abstract

CDO-NQ is a novel optimization algorithm inspired by chaos theory and genetic algorithms. Specifically designed for solving the N-Queens problem, CDO-NQ introduces controlled chaos to efficiently explore the solution space. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's principles, components, and usage.
